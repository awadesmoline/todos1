-- Modify the todo model to add status field
-- modify the delete functionality to only delete tasks that are done
-- modify the update to update status
-- add route to get todo items by status


Design and Build a simple CRUD API for  todos.
 Each task has an id, a title and status.
 There are 3 values for status [In progress, done, not started]).
 I can only delete tasks that are done.
 I can update the status of a task 
I cannot edit the name of a task that is "done".
 I should be able to view tasks by Id, and by status
